# Swift For Arduino Organisation

This is a place for the community to gather and share projects. Most people will be interested in the community repository, which is where we share programs actually written with the S4A IDE itself. Libraries that help people use peripherals for example.

If you really want to contribute to the S4A project, either documenting your projects, with youtube and social media and/or contributing code here are the best way to make this grow.

We can get contributions for the internal platform libraries or even compiler patches from advanced users, but these are typically less useful to be honest. Sample code and documentation of projects (hardware AND code) are the most useful thing for getting buzz and helping new people join the community.
